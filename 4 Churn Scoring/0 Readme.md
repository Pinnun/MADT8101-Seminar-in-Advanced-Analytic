# Churn Project     
To explored and performed an analysis of an e-commerce dataset.     
To ran different classification algorithms with sci-kit learnâ€™s Pipeline method.     
To used GreedsearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to find the best algorithm with the best set of parameters.     
Finally found out the features that had more influence on prediction.     
So, this was all about customer churn analysis and prediction.
