[1.Customer Data Platform](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/34438fbee923f23b3edbcabd98c158b1027efd27/1%20Customer%20Data%20Platform)

>**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** is a platform that amalgamates and manages customer data from various sources. The goal of a CDP is to provide businesses with a complete view of the customer by enabling other analytics tools to use the data and provide useful insights.     
As you approach architecting your Customer Data Platform (CDP), make sure you have identified what the data your business specific needs, the potential value this data can drive, and how you are going to activate it. This will help you create the most efficient strategy for your business.


>**Customer Single View** an accessible and consistent set of information about how a customer has interacted with your company, including what they have bought, their personal data, opinions and feedback.The benefit is understanding how purchases, interactions, and behaviors of customers will drive future actions




[2.Customer Insight Analysis](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/ae18b50d6e2b393281f7a4a00f8348c84d3854ff/2%20Customer%20Insight%20Analysis)

>**Customer analytics** is the process where data collected from different sources is analysed to determine, attract, and maintain customers. It helps businesses draw useful insights, create more useful products, deliver better services, and develop more profitable business decisions.

[3.CLV Customer Scoring](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/0ca31820d607e0da4f641bffaa596564e4a4824e/3%20CLV_CustomerScoring)

>**Customer lifetime value** is the dollar value of a customer relationship based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the relationship     


>**Customer Scoring** Customer scoring is a technique in which a score is attributed to each customer in your database. It’s based on two key ideas:   
  
  • **Not all customers are alike.** You may want to focus your marketing efforts on certain customer profiles, as some of them are more likely to make purchases, have a larger average basket size, shop more frequently, have a higher customer satisfaction score, etc. Customer scoring enables you to identify these customers.     
  • **Successful marketing means setting priorities.** The goal is to improve your performance by focusing your marketing campaigns on the customers that are most likely to make a purchase.     

**Use Case** *Shopee member teir*


[4.Churn Scoring](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/46d053976805acbbbfb371456c5c47340753b776/4%20Churn%20Scoring)

>**Churn Prediction Model** is a predictive model that calculates, on an individual customer basis, the likelihood (or susceptibility) that a customer will stop doing business with the company.     


**Use Case** *E Commerce Churn Prediction*
The result of the analysis was shown as a confusion matrix and a bivariate and multivariate analysis.


[5.Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/04d74e05d830d4532a1644fedbf137e0edb1b0ec/5%20Customer%20Segmentation_Product%20Recommendation)

>**Customer Segmentation**is the process of dividing a company's customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.     
▪ Clustering = Unsupervised Classification

**K-means**: applicable only when mean is defined and need to specify k, the number of clusters, in advance but sensitive to noisy data and outliers
The steps of K-means clustering are:
1. Determine the number of clusters (k).
2. Select initial centroids.
3. Map each data point into the nearest cluster (most similar to centroid).
4. Update the mean value (centroid) of each cluster.
5. Repeat step 3–4 until all centroids are not changed.


>**Product Recommendation**     
A product recommendation is basically a filtering system that seeks to predict and show the items that a user 
would like to purchase. It may not be entirely accurate, but if it shows you what you like then it is doing its job 
right.     

**Collaborative filtering**
Collaborative Filtering recommends items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption behind the algorithm is that users with similar interests have common preferences.     


**Use Case** *HDI holding case*     
There are the processes of data preparation, modeling, and dashboard showing to adapt to business.

[6.Voice of Customer](https://github.com/Pinnun/MADT8101-Seminar-in-Advanced-Analytic/tree/a2d5e840b99542d2979655b863499ba66261abae/6%20VOC)     
![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLP-yellow)  ![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Grey)     

     
>**Voice of Customer (VoC)** analytics is how you turn qualitative and quantitative customer feedback into categorized datasets that can be analyzed to fill gaps in the customer journey experience. This includes labeling and categorizing feedback into appropriate buckets so you can aggregate data like you would with numerical data.


**VoC tools**     
▪ Sentiment analysis     
▪ Fake review identification     
▪ Topic identification     
▪ Net promoter score     
▪ Named entity recognition


**Use Case** *Voice of Customer : SALA Samui Chaweng Beach Resort*     
The topics include topic modeling with LDA, results for topic modeling with LDA, and VOC extraction information.
