     Voice of Customer (VoC) analytics is how you turn qualitative and quantitative customer feedback into 
categorized datasets that can be analyzed to fill gaps in the customer journey experience. This includes labeling 
and categorizing feedback into appropriate buckets so you can aggregate data like you would with numerical 
data.
VoC tools
▪ Sentiment analysis
▪ Fake review identification
▪ Topic identification
▪ Net promoter score
▪ Named entity recognition
